# MLCompiler

A compiler written in F# for a micro version of the ML programming language (we called it HawkFun) for the Fall 2016 semester of CS:3820 Programming Language Concepts. This project was completed in collaboration with my longtime friend Sam Knepper. We ended up in the top tier of our class with a 96% on the course project, which we were quite happy with.   

# How to write progams using the language: testing.fsx
The testing.fsx file contains the commandline arguments needed to execute the compiler, from there you can write and execute your HawkFun programs using F# Interactive in the testing.fsx file.

# Check out proj.pdf
A complete discription of the project can be found in the proj.pdf file.
