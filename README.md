# MLCompiler

A compiler written in F# for a micro version of the ML programming language (we called it HawkFun) for the Fall 2016 semester of CS:3820 Programming Language Concepts. This project was completed in collaboration with my longtime friend Sam Knepper. We ended up with a 96% on the project, which we were quite happy with.   

The testing.fsx file contains the commandline arguments needed to execute the compiler, from there you can write and execute your HawkFun programs using F# Interactive in the testing.fsx file.
